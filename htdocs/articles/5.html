                    <p>Problem solving is unquestionably one of the most important skills for programmers; other skills such as writing efficient code, effective communication, working with a team (and many others) are also very important. It’s impossible to say any one skill is the MOST important</p>
                    <p>Programming books do teach problem solving. Unfortunately there are limitations on what can actually be taught. As others have pointed out, it is mostly learned through experience.
                    For example, an introductory algorithms course will spend a lot of time focused on sorting algorithms. Now, in “real life” programming you can just call a sorting method and don’t have to worry about all the implementation details taught in algorithms, so on the surface it seems like a trivial exercise.</p>
                    <p>The point of the whole discussion is to get students to see the problem solving process in action. Designing a sorting algorithm is a basic example of a “problem” that needs to be “solved”. Understanding how to implement different algorithms and select the best strategy for sorting helps you learn how to solve problems, in a very rudimentary way. Careful examination of what is covered in this type of analysis will improve your problem solving process. Unfortunately, most students just learn the algorithms and complete the exercises, and don’t dig deeper than that.</p>
                    <p>Part of the reason that it seems like problem solving isn’t taught is that programming books give you the answers. It wouldn’t be a very helpful tool if the book just suggested the problem and its constraints without giving the solution. So, there is a problem, then there is the solution, often accompanied by the thought process behind the solution which is the problem solving process.</p>
                    <p>If you just read the book and implement the solution, you aren’t learning to solve the problem. A more effective method is to read the problem, then close the book and try to come up with a solution. After creating a solution on your own, go back and compare your results with what is written in the book. Then you learn how to solve problems.</p>
